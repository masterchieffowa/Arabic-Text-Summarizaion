# Arabic-Text-Summarizaion
Arabic text summarization using T5 base transformer and fine-tuning on AIC-1 dataset.

### Key Features:

1- T5 Base Transformer: The project leverages the T5 base transformer model, which is pre-trained on a large corpus of text data. This model is known for its ability to handle a wide range of NLP tasks, including text summarization.

2- AIC-1 Dataset: The AIC-1 (Arabic Intelligent Content) dataset is used for fine-tuning the T5 model. This dataset is carefully curated and annotated for Arabic text summarization, providing a valuable resource for training and evaluation.

3- Preprocessing and Tokenization: The repository includes preprocessing scripts and tokenization utilities specifically designed for Arabic text. These ensure proper handling of the unique characteristics and linguistic nuances of the Arabic language.

4- Fine-tuning Pipeline: The repository provides a complete pipeline for fine-tuning the T5 base model on the AIC-1 dataset. This includes data loading, model configuration, training, and evaluation scripts to streamline the fine-tuning process.

5- Evaluation Metrics: The project implements commonly used evaluation metrics for text summarization, such as ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation), to assess the quality and effectiveness of the generated summaries.

6- Example Notebooks: The repository includes example notebooks that demonstrate the usage of the Arabic text summarization framework. These notebooks showcase the steps involved in fine-tuning the T5 model, generating summaries, and evaluating the results.

### Contributions and Usage:

We welcome contributions from the community to enhance the Arabic text summarization framework. Developers and researchers interested in Arabic NLP can utilize this repository for their projects, experiment with different hyperparameters, and contribute improvements to the fine-tuning pipeline or evaluation metrics.
